#major project of 3rd year
>there were a lot of unexpected variables that caused everything to be rushed
 
>I was working on the backend user data and converting html files to jsx files so they were compatible as I was the only one to have studied react.
>react was recommended by the lecturer however if I could do it over I would have pushed for a coding style we were all familiar whit so I could get more help 

>the project was done whit scrum architecture in mind however there was a rotating scrum master which I believed caused disorganization
